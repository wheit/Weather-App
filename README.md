Weather App is a React application that allows users to search for weather information for a given location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it to the user. It allows users to search for weather information for any city, view current weather information for their current location, and add/remove cities to/from a list of favorite cities. The app also displays an appropriate background image based on the current weather condition.

Run the app:

1.git clone repository<br>

2.npm install<br>

3.npm start<br>
